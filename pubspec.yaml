# build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.

flutter:

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/image1.jpg
    - assets/images/image2.jpg
    - assets/images/image3.jpg
    - assets/images/image4.jpg
    - assets/images/image5.jpg
    - assets/images/image6.jpg
    - assets/images/image7.jpg
    - assets/images/minion.png
    - assets/images/kids.png
    - assets/images/user.png
    - assets/images/leisure.png
    - assets/images/speaking.jpg
    - assets/images/swimming.jpg
    - assets/animations/MultiOptionButton.flr
    - assets/animations/tiger.flr
    - assets/images/Kevin_minions.png
    - assets/images/how-to-roll-up-calendars-in-sharepoint-icons-png-22.png

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Bebas
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/bebas_regular.otf
        - asset: assets/fonts/bebas_bold.otf
          weight: 700
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins_regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins_bold.ttf
          weight: 700
